Foltest insists that his daughter not be harmed, but reluctantly grants Geralt permission to kill her if Geralt decides that Adda cannot be returned to human form. A more difficult question, to which Geralt can give no certain answer, is whether Adda, who has been a monster her whole life, can live as a \"normal\" human even if the curse is lifted.\r\n\r\nGeralt spends the night at the old palace, which houses the striga. Lord Ostrit, a magnate from Novigrad, arrives and tries to bribe Geralt into leaving without confronting the striga. Ostrit wants to use the striga as proof of Foltest's inability to rule, convincing Temeria's people to support Novigrad's usurpation of rule from Foltest. Geralt refuses and knocks out Ostrit to use him as bait for the striga.\r\n\r\nGeralt fights with the striga and soon overcomes her, despite the striga's resistance to silver, which normally easily defeats monsters. Unable to subdue the striga, Geralt seals himself into its crypt, forcing it to spend the night outside its lair and thus lifting the curse. In the morning, Geralt approaches the seemingly-restored Adda, only for the girl to lunge at him and savagely claw his neck. Geralt binds his wounds and faints, but regains consciousness in the temple, being told that Adda is being cared for by the King and Geralt has earned his reward.", "rating": "9.0", "genre": 1, "authors": [1]}}, {"model": "books.book", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "Sword of destiny", "price": "40.00", "image": "book_pics/sword_of_destiny.jpg", "publication_year": 1992, "description": "Geralt of Rivia meets with the traveling knight Borch \"Three Jackdaws\" and his Zerrikanian bodyguards Tea and Vea, who are on an adventure to see a green dragon.

Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class, courage, compassion, and gender roles in the Deep South. The book is widely taught in schools in the United States with lessons that emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice.[2] Despite its themes, To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms, often challenged for its use of racial epithets.
